        <div class="title">Big Brother Barometer</div>
        This fun little vulnerability uses machine learning to break into a locked smartphone using only the motion sensors.
        <br/><br/>
        Here's how it works.

        The attack starts innocently, with a game of Whack-A-Mole. 
        <br/>
        The user taps on different parts of the screen, and the game records the occurrence of each tap.

        Unbeknownst to the user, the game also records the data from their phone's air pressure sensor,

        ...as well as the three rotational motion sensors.

        Notice how every time the user taps, there's a spike in the pressure sensor?

        This signal can be trained with a windowed regression model

        Unfortunately, the trend does not continue. Midway into the talk my Um's and Ah's spike. I continue to use them pretty consistently throughout the rest of the talk.

        <div class="title">The Cough Effect</div>
        My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.

        The world may never know, or care, but hopefully these insights improve my speaking in 2015. Though preliminary results aren't looking so good.
